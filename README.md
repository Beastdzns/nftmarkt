# NFTMarkt

This project aims to bridge the gap between the Bitcoin ecosystem, Ethereum, and the Sui Network, enabling seamless asset transfers and liquidity integration. Users will be able to purchase assets on the Sui Network using Bitcoin (via Lightning Network) and Ethereum. The project also integrates NFC technology for easy NFT claiming, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

## Features:
- *Bitcoin to Sui asset purchase via Lightning Network*
- *Ethereum integration (currently in development)*
- *NFC tag-based NFT claiming*
- *WebLN integration using Alby Network*
- *Cross-chain liquidity and adoption of Sui assets*

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary dependencies at the root of the project.

bash
npm install


### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

After that, navigate to the packages/frontend directory and install the required frontend dependencies.

bash
cd packages/frontend
npm install


### 3. Run the Project

To start the development server, run the following command inside the packages/frontend folder:

bash
npm run dev


This will start the project and open it in your browser, allowing you to test the integration of Bitcoin and Ethereum assets on the Sui Network and interact with the NFC-enabled NFTs.

## Technologies Used:
- *Bitcoin* (via Lightning Network)
- *Ethereum* (in development)
- *Sui Network*
- *WebLN (Alby Network integration)*
- *NFC Technology*
- *Move (Sui's smart contract language)*
- *React* (Frontend)

## Challenges We Encountered:
- Developing the Move code for Sui's ecosystem.
- Integrating NFC technology for easy NFT claims.
- Ensuring secure and seamless cross-chain transactions.
  
## Future Work:
- Full integration of Ethereum for cross-chain transactions.
- Additional features to enhance the decentralized NFT ecosystem on Sui.
